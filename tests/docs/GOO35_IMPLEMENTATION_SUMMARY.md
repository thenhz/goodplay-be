## üíª Developer Experience Transformation

### Before GOO-35 (Legacy Pattern)
```python
class TestAuthService:
    def setUp(self):
        # 40+ lines of manual setup
        self.mock_user_repo = Mock()
        self.mock_jwt_service = Mock()
        self.mock_bcrypt = Mock()
        # ... extensive configuration

    def test_user_login(self):
        # 25+ lines of test setup and mocking
        user_data = {
            'email': 'test@example.com',
            'password': 'hashedpassword',
            'role': 'user'
        }
        # ... complex assertion logic
        # Total: ~80 lines of code
```

### After GOO-35 (Modern Pattern)
```python
class TestAuthService(BaseAuthTest):
    service_class = AuthService

    def test_user_login(self):
        user = self.create_test_user(email='test@example.com', role='user')
        self.mock_successful_login(user)
        result = self.service.login(user['email'], 'password')
        self.assert_auth_response_success(result, expected_tokens=True)
        # Total: 8 lines of code - 90% reduction!
```
